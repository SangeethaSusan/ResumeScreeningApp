# Resume Screening App
The rapid growth in job applications across industries has increased the need for efficient and automated resume screening systems. Manual shortlisting is often time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human bias.
In this project, we develop a machine learning-based Resume Screening System that automates the classification of resumes into predefined job categories. The system pre-processes textual data using NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, and victimization (TF-IDF / word embedding). Various supervised learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, XGBoost, and LightGBM are implemented and compared to identify the most effective approach. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of resumes and evaluated using accuracy. 
Additionally, a user-friendly interface is developed with Streamlit to allow recruiters to upload resumes and instantly receive predictions. The proposed system reduces the recruiterâ€™s workload, ensures consistency in candidate shortlisting, and demonstrates how data-driven approaches can enhance the recruitment process.
